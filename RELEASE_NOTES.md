### Known issues

* The authentication is based on Keycloak and hardcoded
  to use https://login.akvotest.org
* Akvo Flow survey import is limited to non monitoring surveys
* When working with transformations the user's browser experience
  an increasing memory consumption on each iteration. This is based
  on the fact that we support history/undo capabilities.
  The proper fix is already a work in progress: Issue #262
